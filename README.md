# Food Shopping Order

Built this out of React. A food order app which you can select meals for home delivery.

You can add or remove food items and open and close cart. You can place order and enter a delivery address. However, please note that you will only be sending data to a back end server. This is simply a test app I built to learn and understand the basics of React.
