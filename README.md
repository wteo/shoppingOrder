# Food Shopping Order

Built this out of React. A food order app which you can select meals for home delivery.

This is based on the Food Order project built under section 11 and 17 of the "React-The Complete Guide" course by Maximilian and Schwarzmuller. While I had guidance from the tutorial, I have added some of my own flair to the project such as changing the food theme from Western to Malaysian and adding images to each of the food selection. 

You can add or remove food items and open and close cart. You can place order and enter a delivery address. However, please note that you will only be sending data to a back end server. This is simply a test app I built to learn and understand the basics of React.
